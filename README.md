fractally-island
----------------
Just a small fractal terrain generator. Run with one command-line option-the
name of the file to stuff your island into. If it ends in "png", you'll get a
picture; otherwise, it will be a giant text grid suitable for importing into
your favorite plotting program or island simulator.
